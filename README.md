# Computer Systems Coursework

This assignment uses the Little Man Computer Simulator, which can be found [here](https://community.dur.ac.uk/m.j.r.bordewich/LMC.html). The Windows software can also be found in this repository.

## Task

You should create a LMC program to convert numbers from one base to another. Your program should take three inputs, `n`, `a` and `b` and convert the number `n` from base `a` to base `b`.

Your program should correctly run a second time if the program is set to zero at any time. As an advanced objective, your program should detect overflow whenever it occurs and output 999 to indicate this error.

Your program should handle all inputs elegantly, returning 999 whenever it cannot correctly compute the base conversion.
